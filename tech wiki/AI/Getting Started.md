One of the most commonly asked questions in this sub is how to get started with AI. If you want to get into the field, please refer to the information below and feel free to [make a text post](https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/submit?selftext=true) on the main subreddit to ask additional questions or post more tips.

## What do you want _exactly_?

Often people asking questions here just say they want to get into "AI" without realizing that 1) that term means different things to different people, and 2) it is a very broad field. Generally speaking, it would help people answering your questions a lot if you could say a little bit about what interests you about AI specifically, and why you want to get into the field (interest, money, fame, job security?).

### Narrow AI or General AI?

AI means different things to different people, and one of the biggest divides that exists is between narrow/weak/applied/specialized/"mainstream" AI (ANI) and general/strong/human-level/humanlike/"true" AI (AGI; or HLAI for human-level). (There are some differences between the things I grouped together, but I won't dwell on them here.)

ANI is basically about building useful tools for specialized tasks that previously only humans could do, while AGI is trying to build machines with (super)human-level intelligence across the board. To complicate matters, the division actually isn't very clean, and people often don't use explicit prefixes like "narrow" and "humanlike", and just assume others know what they mean when they say "AI"...

Most laymen seem to think that the field of "AI" is about trying to create AGI, but that's not really true: 99% is narrow AI. So if you want to pursue a career in AI, _this_ is probably what you will be doing. At least, it's where the most jobs, money, etc. is (until someone invents AGI, in which case they will have all the money).

### What branch of AI?

If you look at the [Wikipedia page on AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) (and you really should if you're thinking about getting into the field), you will notice that there are a lot of different goals, tools, approaches and applications. Each is basically its own (sub)field of study.

The most popular subfield is probably Machine Learning (ML), to the point where it gets conflated with the much broader AI field (because how can something be intelligent if it doesn't learn, right?). [Machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) itself is also very broad, and has many of its own subfields.

If you're asking about what kind of education to get, or what kind of project to get started with, please tell us a little bit about which branch of AI you're thinking about. If you don't know what you like, one of the best ways to find out is to take an online Intro to AI course (e.g. on Udacity or EdX).

### Research or applications?

This is obviously not a strict division either, but there is a big difference between a professor researching some abstract theory of intelligence and someone setting up an AI system to meet their client's needs. If you want a career in academia, you should publish a lot and network your ass off with professors and at conferences. For some programming-heavy (industry) jobs, you're going to want an online portfolio (e.g. on GitHub). For some high-end R&D jobs in industry, you need a PhD. For some other jobs you just need to know how to use some neural network library. Etc.

## How to get started with narrow/regular AI?

### Books

The #1 most recommended book in AI is Russell & Norvig's [AI: A Modern Approach](http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/) (AIMA). Chapter 1 (from the first edition), i.e. the introduction, is [online](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/%7Erussell/aima1e/chapter01.pdf) on Stuart Russell's page. [Here](https://artint.info/2e/html/ArtInt2e.html) is also a free online book by Poole & Mackworth.

For different branches of AI, there are obviously going to be different books. For ML, my "Bible" is Bishop's [Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning](http://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780387310732), but there are also officially freely available books: Hastie et al.'s [The Elements of Statistical Learning](http://statweb.stanford.edu/%7Etibs/ElemStatLearn/), Goodfellow et al.'s [Deep Learning](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/), Sutton & Barto's [Introduction to Reinforcement Learning](http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html) and Andrew Ng's [Machine Learning Yearning](https://www.mlyearning.org/). Here is also a [list of free machine learning books](https://github.com/josephmisiti/awesome-machine-learning/blob/master/books.md).

### Online courses

Platforms like [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/), [EdX](https://www.edx.org/) and [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) offer lots of courses on AI, ML, computer science (CS), programming, math and other related topics.

My favorite Intro to AI course was probably Dan Klein and Pieter Abbeel's on [EdX/BerkeleyX](https://courses.edx.org/courses/BerkeleyX/CS188x_1/1T2013/info); it's no longer active/available there, but I think you can take the same course or at least find the materials [here](http://ai.berkeley.edu/home.html)). EdX has a newer [MicroMaster's program](https://www.edx.org/micromasters/columbiax-artificial-intelligence) and [course](https://www.edx.org/course/artificial-intelligence-ai-columbiax-csmm-101x-0) on AI by Ansaf Salleb-Aouissi that I haven't taken.

I also liked Udacity's [Intro to AI](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-artificial-intelligence--cs271) and the subsequent [AI for Robotics](https://www.udacity.com/course/artificial-intelligence-for-robotics--cs373). I have not taken their [Knowledge-Based AI: Cognitive Systems](https://eu.udacity.com/course/knowledge-based-ai-cognitive-systems--ud409) course, but it looks interesting. [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) does not appear to have a course on just AI, but they have a _lot_ of excellent courses on various subfields.

Probably the best online beginner course on ML is [Andrew Ng's](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning). On the slightly more advanced side Coursera also used to haveGeoff Hinton's _Neural Networks for ML_ (discontinued on Coursera, but the lectures are still available [here](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/%7Ehinton/coursera_lectures.html)) and Daphne Koller's [Probabilistic Graphical Models](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/probabilistic-graphical-models), but honestly Coursera just has way too much to mention on AI, ML, CS and data science. Another [great beginner course on ML](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning--ud262) on Udacity is given by Charles Isbell and Michael Littmann, and they also have a course on [TensorFlow/Deep Learning](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning--ud730) by Google. I have no experience with Udacity's nanodegrees, but it seems they are offering one for [machine learning](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009) (and one for [self-driving car engineers](https://www.udacity.com/drive)). Finally, I can also heartily recommend [David Silver's course on reinforcement learning](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/d.silver/web/Teaching.html).

EdX, Udacity and esp. Coursera have a lot more courses on relevant topics for AI, so I would encourage people to look around a bit (probably after taking some intro to AI/ML).

### University

Maybe you're actually going to university and would like to know what to study. Again, it depends. AI has elements of Computer Science (CS), Cognitive Science (CogSci), mathematics, philosophy, mechatronics (which is electrical+mechanical+computer engineering), linguistics, (computational) neuroscience and probably more. If your university offers an AI (or ML) program and you're interested in AI: take that program. (This may seem obvious, but people have questioned whether they should study e.g. CS instead.)

If not, then most universities offer the most AI-like stuff in the CS department. I think CS and math are, generally speaking, the most important things to study, especially if you want to get into narrow AI. Cognitive science and philosophy become more important if you want to do AGI, but you still need CS and math as well. I posted a bit about math vs. CS [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/agi/comments/5bwx7j/do_you_think_an_undergrad_education_in/d9sxokm/).

If you're going to take individual courses, again prioritize something that's literally called "Intro to AI/ML". Barring that, I think that [math courses](https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/tbmjg/what_college_courses_should_i_take_if_i_want_to/) will typically help you more than e.g. programming courses, because it seems math is the [hardest to learn](http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/a/14013) on your own (YMMV of course). Of course, if you're super interested in natural language processing then you should probably do some linguistics, or if you like the brain you could do some neuroscience, etc.

### Programming languages

People often ask about what programming language to learn. The most important thing is that you learn how to program, period. The language itself should not matter that much, so you can just choose whatever your university, engineering club, open source project / library or whatever uses. Having said that, Python and C++ are probably the most commonly used languages, and Python seems to be widely regarded as a great first language. It's a good idea to try to do some projects (of increasing size, starting small). Having a portfolio on GitHub can help boost your résumé.

## How to get started with AGI?

Nobody really knows how to build AGI. It's an incredibly difficult problem and (because of this?) relatively few people are focused on this specifically (although I think it's getting better). Some think deep learning will get us there based on recent successes, but it's not clear that it will, and in the end it's just one family of approaches with (currently) still many shortcomings. If you're serious about AGI, I think you should learn the "regular" AI curriculum (see above), but also delve into the various approaches for achieving AGI that are out there (see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/2f8c56/what_is_this_subreddit_about/ck88z9w) for a very incomplete list).

The [AGI Society](http://www.agi-society.org/) has a [journal](https://content.sciendo.com/view/journals/jagi/jagi-overview.xml), an annual [conference](http://agi-conf.org/), a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCwJ8AV1zMM4j9FTicGimqA) with videos from recent conferences and the [2013 summer school](http://www.mindmakers.org/projects/agi-summer-school-2013/documents) and a very helpful [resources page](http://www.agi-society.org/resources/). I would especially recommend reading Ben Goertzel's 2014 [overview paper](http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/jagi.ahead-of-print/jagi-2014-0001/jagi-2014-0001.xml) and Pei Wang's [Gentle Introduction to AGI](https://cis.temple.edu/%7Epwang/AGI-Intro.html), and looking at the suggested education plans. For things from different organizations than the AGI Society, you could also look at Facebook's [Machine Intelligence workshop](https://mainatnips.github.io/) at NIPS last year, and the various activities of the [BICA Society](http://bicasociety.org/) (which stands for "Biologically Inspired Cognitive Architectures").

Three AGI researchers have suggested the following education plans:

- [Suggested Education for Future AGI Researchers](https://cis.temple.edu/%7Epwang/AGI-Curriculum.html) by Pei Wang
- [Sketch of an AGI Curriculum](http://wp.goertzel.org/agi-curriculum/) by Ben Goertzel
- [Marcus' AI Recommendation Page](http://www.hutter1.net/ai/introref.htm) by Marcus Hutter
