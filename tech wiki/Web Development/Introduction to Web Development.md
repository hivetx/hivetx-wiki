Web development is the process of building and maintaining websites. It involves various tasks such as designing the layout, writing code, and ensuring the website functions properly across different devices and browsers. Web development is typically divided into two main areas:

- **Front-End Development:** Focuses on the client-side of web development, including everything users interact with directly.
- **Back-End Development:** Handles the server-side, including databases, server logic, and application functionality that users don't see.

Web development requires a mix of technical skills, including programming, design, and problem-solving, to create effective and engaging websites and web applications.
